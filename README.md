# Uber-ETL-Automation-with-Airflow-Mage

## Introduction
The project focuses on performing thorough data analytics on Uber datasets, leveraging an array of tools like GCP Storage, Python, Compute Instance, Mage Data Pipeline Tool, BigQuery, and Looker Studio. Our methodology includes:

# Project Overview

This project aims to conduct comprehensive data analytics on Uber datasets by leveraging a variety of tools and technologies. The process involves several key steps:

- **Data Structuring with Lucid:** We begin by structuring Uber data using Lucid to create a comprehensive data model.

- **Data Extraction and Transformation with Mage:** Using Mage, we extract data from APIs and transform it into a star schema. Subsequently, the transformed data is loaded into BigQuery, making use of Google Cloud's compute instance.

- **In-depth Analysis on Google BigQuery:** We delve into detailed analysis on Google BigQuery, harnessing its computational capabilities to gain valuable insights from the data.

- **Visualizations with Looker Studio:** Insights derived from the analysis are presented through intuitive visualizations using Google's Looker Studio.

## Dataset Used
TLC Trip Record Data
Yellow and green taxi trip records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts. 

Here is the dataset - https://github.com/rohitaragde/Uber-ETL-Automation-with-Airflow-Mage/blob/master/data/uber_data.csv

## Execution Process

### Step 01: Open Jupyter Notebook and Load the Raw Dataset

Open Jupyter Notebook and load the raw dataset. Have a look at the raw data.

### Step 02: Open Lucid and Create a Data Model

Open Lucid and create a data model based on the raw data.

### Step 03: Perform Aggregations to Convert Data into Data Model

Return to Jupyter Notebook and perform all the necessary aggregations to convert the data into the data model required for replication in Mage.

### Step 04: Setup GCP Compute Instance and BigQuery Bucket

Setup a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Compute instance for Mage

### Step 05: Write Transformation Scripts in Mage

Go to Mage and write the transformation scripts in Python as required.

### Step 06: Perform ETL Process in Mage

Execute the ETL process using Mage. The data will be transformed and later on will be loaded into the Google Cloud BigQuery bucket.

### Step 07: BigQuery Data Load and Analysis

Once the data loader is executed in mage the data will be loaded finally into the bigquery tables with all the transformations performed and where the querying and analysis will be performed.

### Step 08: Perform Some Additional Analysis on the Data



### Step 09: Perform Analysis and Develop Dashboard

Perform analysis on the final data and develop a final dashboard using Google Studio.
